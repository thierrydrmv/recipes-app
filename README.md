## üìù About

The **üçï Recipe App** project is an application where you can view, search, filter, favorite and monitor the progress of preparing recipes and drinks! It was developed in a team, made up of 6 people, on the Trybe course. The database used were 2 different APIs, one for food (TheMealDB) and another for drinks (The CockTailDB). Unit tests were implemented with Jest and activities were organized following the Kanban model, using the Trello tool.
